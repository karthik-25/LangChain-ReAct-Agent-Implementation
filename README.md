# Implementation of a ReAct Agent using LangChain

[ReAct](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.03629.pdf) is a framework that facilitates the combination of **Reasoning** and **Acting** in applications utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs). A ReAct agent can decide on the best course of action based on input, leveraging LLMs for both generating responses and determining actions. This framework is particularly useful for creating applications that require a blend of understanding complex queries and performing specific tasks or generating targeted responses.

This project is a implementation of a ReAct agent using [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) and OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo. The goal was to better understand the ReAct framework and LangChain's features. The ReAct [prompt](https://smith.langchain.com/hub/hwchase17/react) by Harrison Chase (LangChain Creator) was used for this implementation. 

This project is part of "LangChain - Develop LLM powered applications with LangChain" Udemy course by [Eden Marco](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eden-marco/).
